For a while I’ve thought of writing up some of the thoughts and experiences that have shaped my values and who I am, before 30, since I find it to be quite helpful for myself (and it’s full of miracles along the way that many of my friends loved talking with me about). Yet I’ve always procrastinated in finding a space to do so.

But tada - here it is! Hopefully they are also entertaining or helpful to my dear readers, or at least, provoke some reflections. If that is the case, I have fulfilled one of my goals.

I tend to write best in multiple languages, jumping back and forth in whichever can express my thoughts/feelings the best, but I will stick with English on this site for the most part. And forgive me for the streams of consciousness style that I picked up from AP English Literature (particular James Joyce) that I find surprisingly rhythmic.

I wasn’t trained to write, at least in the traditional sense. But words--this magical creation--give me a medium to express, a medium to share, to communicate, to feel my emotions and dive into my thoughts more deeply. I find beauty in words. 

It is with writing that I wrangle with my thoughts, and through that wrangling, often exhausting and sometimes painful, that I find clarity. A clarity that, even though might not directly lead to joy, brings peace and keeps me anchored.

Words also give us a space to experience our commonalities and differences, and to hear stories of people.

Everyone has stories to be heard. And I am here to listen.

I value the organicness of human-human interactions, the genuineness and care that spring up in real active listening and story-telling, amidst this broken world. And it is this very human nature that unites us. It is through such type of active sharing, fueled by our love and compassion, that we will forge our paths forward to solve the pressing challenges that we are facing. And this keeps me hopeful.
